Ideias 


== Enemies 

- Boss with shield, that one has to shoot proper enemies 
	- Kangis with same sounds for exmple
- Enemy that have some options that must be destroied in a certain order (form word? Counting (one, two, three), (ich, ni, san, yon) ?)
- options in two columns that each pair must be shot one after the other (like match two items in different columns)
- Swarm of enemies shoot only those that are mispelled or are wrong ( like a enemy has a wrong gender in german for a word, shoot him)  
=  A possible boss could be a “Kanji cyborg” that assembles kanji from radicals; the player has to shoot the correct combination of radicals or identify the meaning in context (“shoot the kanji that means fire when it appears to disable the boss’s shield”). 

- Enemies like: destroy the item that is not like the others ( maybe rotating around )
== Traps


- Give two options of path ( maybe when hearing something)
	- ex: (to Go)  path 1: went  path 2: goed   < punishment if goed, success if went
== Languages

- Progression paths 
- Incremental improvents as one get more experience (as rewards and milestones)
- Sugestion based on players dificulties

== Improvements
- Too much enemies can get overhelming. 
	Options:
